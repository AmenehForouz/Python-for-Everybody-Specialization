# Loops and Iterations 
- to do repetative tasks
- Loops have **iteration variables** that change each time through a loop, often there iteration variables go through a sequence of numbers.
- indefinite loops - while keyword
- definite loops - for keyword

**indefinite loops - while keyword**

```
    n = 5
    while n > 0:
        print(n)
        n = n-1
    print('Blastoff!')
    print(n)

    Output: 5   4   3   2   1   Blastoff!   0
```

**Breaking out of Loop**
- **Break** statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement immediately following the loop

```
    while True:
        line = input('> ')
        if line == 'done'
            break
        print(line)
    print('Completed!')

output: if we give input as 'done', it will break and output will be Completed!
```

**Finishing an Iteration with Continue**
- **continue** statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and start next iteration.
- Break jumps out of the loop while continue jumps out of the perticular iteration.

```
    while True:
        line = input('> ')
        if line[0] == '#'
            continue
        if line == 'done'
            break
        print(line)
    print('Completed!')

    > hello vidya   ... hello vidya
    > #welcome      ... # won't print anything
    > hello kunal   ... hello kunal
    > done          ... Completed!
```

**Definite Loops : for and in keyword**
- definite loops have explicit iteration variables that change each time through a loop.

```
    for i in [5,4,3,2,1]:
        ptint(i)
    print('Blastoff!')

    output: 5   4   3   2   1   Blastoff!
```

```
    friends = ['vidya','sharayu','teju']
    for friend in friends:
        print('Hey',friend)
    print('Done!')

    Output: 
    Hey vidya
    Hey sharayu
    Hey teju
    Done!
```

**Finding the largest number**
```
    l = -1
    print('before', l)
    for num in [3,41,12,3,74,15]:
        if num > l:
            l = num
        print(l)
    print('After:',l)
        
    Output:
    Before -1
    3
    41
    41
    41
    74
    74
    After: 74
```

**Counting in loop**
```
    cnt = 0
    print('Before:', cnt)
    for num in [3,41,12,3,74,15]:
        cnt = cnt +1
    print('After:',cnt)

    Output:
    Before: 0
    After: 6
```

**Summing in loop**
```
    s = 0
    print('Before:', s)
    for num in [3,41,12,3,74,15]:
        s = s + num
    print('After:',s)

    Output:
    Before: 0
    After: 154
```

**Finding the average in a loop**
```
    s = 0
    cnt =0 
    print('Before:', cnt ,s)
    for num in [3,41,12,3,74,15]:
        cnt = cnt + 1
        s = s+num
    print('After:',cnt,s, s/cnt)

    Output:
    Before: 0 0
    After: 6 154 25
```

**Filtering in the loop**
```
    print('Before')
    for num in [3,41,12,3,74,15]:
        if num > 20
            print('Num larger than 20:',num)
    print('After)

    Output:
    Before
    Num larger than 20: 41
    Num larger than 20: 74
    After
```

**Search a number using Boolean variable**
- search 3 in list, wether it is present or not
```
    flag = False
    print("Before:", flag)
    for num in [9,41,12,3,74,15]:
            if num == 3:
                flag = True
            print(flag,num)
    print('After:',flag)

    Output:
    Before: False
    False 9
    False 41
    False 12
    True 3
    True 74
    True 15
    After: True
```

**Find the smallest value**
```
    s = None
    print('Before:', s)
    for num in [3,41,12,3,74,15]:
        if s == None:
            s = num
        elif num < s:
            s = num
    print('After:',s)

    Output:
    Before: None
    After: 3
```
**we can also use 'is' in place of '=='**
- eg, if s is None or if s is 3
- 'is' is stronger equality than '=='
- best practice is to use it for None, True and False

**None**:
- The None keyword is used to define a null variable or an object. 
- In Python, None keyword is an object, and it is a data type of the class NoneType . 
- We can assign None to any variable, but you can not create other NoneType objects. 
- Note: All variables that are assigned None point to the same object.
