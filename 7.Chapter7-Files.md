# Files
- a text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines.

**Opening a File**
- before we can read the content of file, we must tell python which file we are going to work with and what we will be doing with the file.
- this is done with open() function
- open() returns a **file handle**- a variable used to perform operations on file

- handle = open(filename,mode)
- fhand = open('abc.txt','r')
- filename is a string
- mode is optional and should be 'r' if we are planning to read the file and 'w' if we are going to write to file.

```
    fh = open('7.1.words.txt')
    print(fh)

    output:
    <_io.TextIOWrapper name='7.1.words.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>
```

**newline character**
- indicate when line ends
- we represent it as '\n' in strings
- newline is one character - not two
- text file has newline at the end of each line.
- print() function puts newline at the end
```
    greet = 'hello\nworld'
    print(greet)
    print(len(greet))

    output:
    hello
    world
    11
```

**File handle as sequence of lines**
- file handle open for read can be treated as sequence of strings where each line in file is a string
- we can use for statement to iterate through a sequence
- Remember - sequence is an ordered set.

```
    xfile = open('mbox.txt')
    for l in xfile:
        print(l)
```

**Counting lines in file**
- open file in read only mode
- use for loop to read each line
- count the lines and print out the numbers of lines

```
    fhand = open('abc.txt')
    cnt = 0
    for line in fhand:
        cnt = cnt+!
    print(line count:, cnt)
```

**Reading the whole file using read()**
- we can read the whole file (newline and all) into a **single string**

```
    fhand = open('abc.txt')
    inpstr = fhand.read()
    print(len(inpstr)) # len() is the built in sunction and not from string library
```

**Searching through a File**
- we can use if statement in our for loop to only print lines that meet some criteria
```
    fhand = open('abc.txt')
    for line in fhand:
        line = line.rstrip() #to remove newline at the end of line, bcoz print also adds newline. 
        if line.startwith('The'):
            print(line) 
```
    
**Skipping with continue**
- using continue and **not**
```
    fhand = open('abc.txt')
    for line in fhand:
        line = line.rstrip() 
        if not line.startwith('The'):
            continue
        print(line) 
```

**using 'in' to select lines**
```
    fhand = open('abc.txt')
    for line in fhand:
        line = line.rstrip() 
        if not '@gmail.com' in line:
            continue
        print(line) 
```

Quiz:
1. where are the files stored? - secondary memory
2. What is stored in a "file handle" that is returned from a successful open() call? - handle is connection to files data.
3. What Python function would you use if you wanted to prompt the user for a file name to open? - input()
